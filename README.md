# Console Robot Simulation    

A **console-based robot simulation** where multiple robots move around an arena. Robots follow specific directions and change course when they hit walls or other obstacles. The project demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **random movement**, and **file saving/loading**.

---

## Features

- **Custom Arena Sizes**: Set arena dimensions interactively.
- **Multiple Robots**: Add robots with unique IDs and directions.
- **Random Movement**: Robots move randomly and change direction when needed.
- **Console Commands**: Add, move, display, and simulate robots.
- **Save/Load**: Save the arena state to a file and load it later.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** for core logic.
- **Console I/O** for text-based interaction.
- **File Handling** for saving and loading data.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Simulation**:
   ```bash
   javac Robotsim/*.java
   java Robotsim.RobotInterface
